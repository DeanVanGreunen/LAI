Atom a.k.a Syntactic atoms:
 - The basic unit of syntax is not the word, but the syntactic atom, defined as a structure that fulfills a basic syntactic function. Syntactic atoms may be either a single word or a phrase that fulfills a single syntactic function.
  - _Fido_ ate the bone.

 - _The dog_ ate the bone.

 - _The big yellow dog_ ate the bone.

 - _Our dog that we raised from a puppy_ ate the bone.

 - _Our dog that we raised from a puppy named Fido_ ate the bone.

Elements with syntactic equivalence all belong to the same type of syntactic atom (NP, VP)
